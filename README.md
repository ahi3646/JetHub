# !!! Quick reminder, due to optimization
- app/src/main/java/com/hasan/jetfasthub/screens/login
- app/src/main/java/com/hasan/jetfasthub/screens/main/home - This module is built with the same architecture used in [Tangem](https://github.com/tangem/tangem-app-android) open source
 
packages include real clean code base, other packages will also be optimized later ...
